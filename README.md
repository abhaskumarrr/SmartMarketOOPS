## Usage

### Real-Time Delta Exchange Integration

- The backend securely stores your Delta Exchange API credentials (testnet or mainnet) and streams real-time market data and ML signals via WebSocket.
- The frontend dashboard connects to the backend WebSocket using `socket.io-client` and updates the TradingView-style chart in real time.
- To use your own credentials, add them via the dashboard or backend API (see API Key Management below).
- By default, the frontend connects to the backend WebSocket at `http://localhost:3001`. You can override this with the environment variable:
  ```env
  NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=http://localhost:3001
  ```
  Add this to your `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory if needed.

#### How to Test Live Chart
1. Start all services (backend, frontend, ML, database) as described above.
2. Log in to the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. The main chart will update in real time as new market data arrives from Delta Exchange testnet.
4. You can subscribe to different symbols or intervals as you build out the dashboard UI.

### Trading Dashboard
Access the trading dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` to:
- View real-time market data with SMC indicators (live chart updates via WebSocket)
- Monitor trading signals and executed trades
- Analyze performance metrics
- Configure trading strategies
- Manage API keys securely (testnet/mainnet)

### API Endpoints
The backend provides several API endpoints:

#### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create a new user account

#### API Key Management
- `GET /api/keys` - List all API keys for a user
- `POST /api/keys` - Add a new API key
- `DELETE /api/keys/:id` - Remove an API key

#### Trading
- `GET /api/delta/instruments` - Get available trading instruments
- `GET /api/delta/market/:symbol` - Get real-time market data
- `POST /api/delta/order` - Place a new order
- `GET /api/delta/orders` - Get order history

### ML Service
The ML service exposes endpoints for model training and prediction:
