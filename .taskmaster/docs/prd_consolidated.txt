# SmartMarketOOPS - Smart Money Order Blocks Trading Platform

## Project Overview
SmartMarketOOPS is a sophisticated ML-driven trading system that functions as both a personal trading dashboard for Delta Exchange and a portfolio showcase. The platform integrates advanced machine learning algorithms with real-time market data to identify and execute trades based on Smart Money Order Block patterns.

## Core Features

### Trading Engine
- Real-time market data integration with Delta Exchange
- Smart Money Order Block pattern detection
- ML-powered trade signal generation
- Risk management system
- Position management with automated entry/exit
- Paper trading and live trading modes

### Frontend Dashboard
- Modern, responsive Next.js interface
- Real-time price charts and indicators
- Trade execution panel
- Portfolio performance tracking
- Risk metrics visualization
- Trade history and analytics
- WebSocket integration for live updates

### Backend Infrastructure
- RESTful API for data access and trading operations
- WebSocket server for real-time updates
- Database integration (PostgreSQL)
- Redis caching layer
- Authentication and security
- Trading bot management
- Performance monitoring

### ML System
- TensorFlow/PyTorch models for pattern recognition
- Real-time inference engine
- Model training pipeline
- Performance tracking and optimization
- Automated model retraining
- Feature engineering pipeline

## 2. Frontend Redesign & Professional Dashboard Requirements

(Imported from .taskmaster/docs/frontend-redesign-prd.txt)

Key additions:
- Professional, institutional-grade trading dashboard built with **Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind/shadcn/ui, Zustand, Framer Motion, and TradingView Lightweight Charts**.
- Advanced charting, multi-timeframe analysis, and real-time data streaming via Socket.io.
- AI model execution visualisation, confidence scores, and performance metrics.
- High-performance targets: sub-second page load, <100 ms data latency, 60 fps animations, bundle <500 KB gzipped.
- Phased implementation roadmap (6 weeks) covering foundation, components, trading dashboard, charts, AI integration, and optimisation/polish.

(Complete feature list, technical architecture, UX requirements, success metrics, and implementation phases are included unchanged from the original document.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Implementation Research Requirements

(Imported from .taskmaster/docs/research-prd.txt)

Objectives:
1. Audit the **current SmartMarketOOPS implementation** to determine which components are proven vs. theoretical.
2. Analyse trade-execution capabilities, ML model utilisation, analysis engine accuracy, and infrastructure performance.
3. Identify **integration gaps** between analysis and execution layers.
4. Produce research deliverables: trade-execution report, ML integration assessment, analysis-engine evaluation, integration-architecture review, and implementation roadmap.

Timeline: 4-week research plan covering codebase analysis, functionality testing, performance assessment, and gap analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Extended Institutional-Grade Feature Roadmap

(Imported from PRD_SmartMarketOOPS.md / private_docs/prd.md)

Highlights:
- **Smart Money Concepts (SMC) Engine**: Order Block detection, Fair Value Gap (FVG), liquidity levels, BOS/ChoCH, BSL/SSL mapping.
- **Multi-Timeframe Confluence System**: Higher-timeframe bias, cross-timeframe validations, discount/premium zone logic, confluence scoring.
- **Order Flow Analysis**: DOM integration, bid-ask imbalance, volume profile, large order tracking.
- **Confluence Risk Timing (CRT) Logic** and **Advanced Pattern Recognition** modules.
- Performance goals: signal latency <50 ms, 99.9% uptime, API response <200 ms.
- Detailed implementation roadmap with phased delivery of SMC, confluence system, order-flow, CRT logic, and optimisation.

# Consolidation Notes

- Duplicate PRDs have been merged; this file supersedes:
  - .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt
  - .taskmaster/docs/frontend-redesign-prd.txt
  - .taskmaster/docs/research-prd.txt
  - PRD_SmartMarketOOPS.md / private_docs/prd.md
  - scripts/prd.txt (now deprecated)

- Future updates to requirements should be made **only in this consolidated PRD** to maintain a single source of truth.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Next Step

This consolidated PRD is ready to be parsed by Task Master to generate/update the canonical tasks.json.
