# Intelligent Multi-Timeframe Trading Bot - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Build an intelligent, adaptive trading bot that analyzes positions across multiple timeframes and dynamically adjusts risk management strategies based on real-time market conditions. The bot should replace simple drawdown limits with sophisticated AI-driven position management that considers market regimes, technical analysis, and machine learning insights.

## Problem Statement

Current trading bots use static risk management rules (fixed stop losses, take profits, drawdown limits) that don't adapt to changing market conditions. This leads to:
- Premature position exits during temporary volatility
- Missed profit opportunities in trending markets
- Poor performance across different market regimes
- Lack of intelligent position sizing and management

## Solution Overview

Develop an intelligent trading system that:
1. Analyzes market conditions across multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
2. Adapts position management based on market regime detection
3. Uses ATR-based dynamic stops and take profits
4. Implements machine learning for position health assessment
5. Provides intelligent partial profit taking and position scaling
