## Data Flow

```
Market Data → Data Collection Service → Redis/QuestDB
                ↓
AI Intelligence Service → Trading Signals → Position Management Service
                ↓                              ↓
Risk Management Service ← Event Orchestration → Order Execution Service
                ↓
Multi-Asset Intelligence Service → Portfolio Optimization

### Service Interface Contracts

#### **Input/Output Boundaries**
- Each service has clearly defined input/output schemas
- No direct database access between services (except through APIs)
- Event-driven communication for loose coupling
- Synchronous APIs only for critical real-time operations

#### **Data Ownership**
- **Data Collection Service**: Owns raw market data
- **AI Intelligence Service**: Owns model predictions and signals
- **Position Management Service**: Owns position state and history
- **Risk Management Service**: Owns risk metrics and limits

#### **Failure Isolation**
- Service failures don't cascade to other services
- Circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Independent scaling and deployment

## Next Steps
