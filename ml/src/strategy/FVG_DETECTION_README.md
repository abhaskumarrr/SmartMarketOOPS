# Fair Value Gap (FVG) Detection System

## Overview

The Fair Value Gap Detection System is a sophisticated implementation of Smart Money Concepts (SMC) for identifying institutional Fair Value Gaps in cryptocurrency trading data. FVGs represent areas where price moved so quickly that it left gaps in the market structure, creating zones of inefficiency that often act as support and resistance levels.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Advanced Three-Candle Pattern Analysis**: Identifies FVGs using institutional-grade algorithms
- **Impulse Strength Validation**: Ensures FVGs are formed by significant price movements
- **Volume Confirmation**: Validates FVGs with volume analysis
- **Fill Tracking and Monitoring**: Tracks how FVGs are filled over time
- **Reaction Strength Measurement**: Measures price reactions at FVG levels
- **Multi-Factor Validation Scoring**: Comprehensive quality assessment (0-1 scale)

### Smart Money Concepts Implementation
- **Institutional Gap Detection**: Identifies gaps left by smart money movements
- **Price Inefficiency Analysis**: Detects areas where price moved too quickly
- **Support/Resistance Zones**: FVGs act as key levels for future price action
- **Fill Rate Analysis**: Statistical analysis of how often FVGs get filled

## Architecture

### Main Classes

#### `FairValueGap` (Data Class)
Represents a detected Fair Value Gap with comprehensive properties:
- `type`: FVGType.BULLISH or FVGType.BEARISH
- `top/bottom`: Price boundaries of the gap
- `size`: Absolute size of the gap
- `percentage`: Gap size as percentage of price
- `impulse_strength`: Strength of the impulse that created the gap
- `validation_score`: Multi-factor quality score (0-1)
- `status`: FVGStatus (ACTIVE, PARTIALLY_FILLED, FULLY_FILLED, EXPIRED)
- `fill_percentage`: How much of the gap has been filled
- `touches`: Number of times price has tested the gap
- `max_reaction`: Maximum price reaction at the gap level

#### `FVGDetector`
Core detection engine with advanced algorithms:
- Three-candle pattern analysis
- Impulse strength calculation
- Volume threshold validation
- Fill tracking and monitoring
- Reaction strength measurement
- Statistical analysis and reporting

#### `FVGType` and `FVGStatus` (Enums)
Type-safe enumerations for gap classification and status tracking.

## Algorithm Details

### Detection Criteria

#### Bullish Fair Value Gaps
1. **Formation**: Three-candle pattern where candle 3 low > candle 1 high
2. **Impulse**: Middle candle shows strong bullish movement (≥1.5% default)
3. **Volume**: Formation occurs during high volume period (≥70th percentile)
4. **Gap Size**: Minimum gap size threshold (≥0.1% default)

#### Bearish Fair Value Gaps
1. **Formation**: Three-candle pattern where candle 3 high < candle 1 low
2. **Impulse**: Middle candle shows strong bearish movement (≥1.5% default)
3. **Volume**: Formation occurs during high volume period (≥70th percentile)
4. **Gap Size**: Minimum gap size threshold (≥0.1% default)

### Validation Scoring
Multi-factor scoring system (0-1 scale):
- **Gap Size Factor** (0-0.25): Relative to Average True Range
- **Impulse Strength Factor** (0-0.3): Strength of formation impulse
- **Volume Factor** (0-0.25): Volume relative to threshold
- **Gap Percentage Factor** (0-0.2): Size as percentage of price

### Fill Tracking
Comprehensive monitoring system:
- **Active Status**: Gap has not been touched by price
- **Partially Filled**: Price has entered the gap but not filled it completely
- **Fully Filled**: Price has completely filled the gap
- **Touch Counting**: Number of times price has tested the gap
- **Reaction Measurement**: Strength of price reactions at gap levels

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from fvg_detection import FVGDetector
import pandas as pd

# Load your OHLCV data
ohlcv = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Initialize detector
detector = FVGDetector(
    ohlcv,
    min_gap_percentage=0.001,      # 0.1% minimum gap
    min_impulse_strength=0.015,    # 1.5% minimum impulse
    volume_threshold_percentile=70  # 70th percentile volume
)

# Detect FVGs
fvgs = detector.identify_fvgs()

# Track fills
fill_stats = detector.track_fvg_fills()

# Get statistics
stats = detector.get_fvg_statistics()
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# Custom configuration for different market conditions
detector = FVGDetector(
    ohlcv,
    min_gap_percentage=0.002,      # Higher threshold for volatile markets
    min_impulse_strength=0.025,    # Stronger impulse requirement
    volume_threshold_percentile=80  # Higher volume threshold
)

# Detect with impulse validation
fvgs = detector.identify_fvgs(validate_impulse=True)

# Get active FVGs near current price
current_price = ohlcv['close'].iloc[-1]
active_fvgs = detector.get_active_fvgs(current_price)

# Validate specific FVG quality
for fvg in fvgs:
    validation = detector.validate_fvg_quality(fvg)
    if validation['quality_level'] == 'high':
        print(f"High-quality {fvg.type.value} FVG at {fvg.get_midpoint()}")
```

### Integration with SMC System
```python
from smc_detection import SMCDector

# Initialize SMC detector (automatically includes enhanced FVG detection)
smc = SMCDector(ohlcv)

# Detect all patterns with enhanced FVG analysis
results = smc.detect_all()

# Access enhanced FVG statistics
if 'fvg_statistics' in results:
    fvg_stats = results['fvg_statistics']
    print(f"Enhanced FVG detection: {fvg_stats['enhanced_detection']}")
    print(f"Fill success rate: {fvg_stats['fill_success_rate']:.1%}")
```

### Convenience Function
```python
from fvg_detection import get_enhanced_fvgs

# Quick access to enhanced FVGs
fvgs = get_enhanced_fvgs(
    ohlcv,
    min_gap_percentage=0.0015,
    min_impulse_strength=0.02
)

# Each FVG includes comprehensive data
for fvg in fvgs:
    print(f"{fvg['type']} FVG: {fvg['size']:.2f} ({fvg['percentage']:.3%})")
    print(f"Validation score: {fvg['validation_score']:.3f}")
    print(f"Status: {fvg['status']}, Fill: {fvg['fill_percentage']:.1f}%")
```
