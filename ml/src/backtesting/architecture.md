# Backtesting Engine Architecture

## Overview

The backtesting engine is designed to simulate trading strategies on historical cryptocurrency data with a specific focus on Smart Money Concepts (SMC), Fair Value Gaps (FVGs), and liquidity analysis. The architecture follows modular design principles to ensure flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Module
- **Purpose**: Fetch and preprocess historical OHLCV data for backtesting
- **Features**:
  - Support for multiple data sources (CSV files, APIs)
  - Ability to handle varying timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d)
  - Preprocessing of data for technical analysis
  - Calculation of SMC-specific indicators (Order Blocks, FVGs, Liquidity zones)
  - Data caching for improved performance

### 2. Strategy Execution Module
- **Purpose**: Implement and execute trading strategies based on signals
- **Features**:
  - Define strategy interface for consistent implementation
  - Support for SMC-based strategies
  - Signal generation from ML models and technical indicators
  - Position management
  - Event-driven architecture for strategy execution
  - Support for strategy composition and combination

### 3. Order Execution & Simulation Module
- **Purpose**: Simulate market/limit orders and their execution
- **Features**:
  - Realistic market simulator with slippage
  - Support for different order types (market, limit, stop)
  - Time-based or tick-based simulation
  - Adjustable commission/fee structure
  - Realistic simulation of order fills based on market depth

### 4. Portfolio & Risk Management Module
- **Purpose**: Manage virtual portfolio and implement risk controls
- **Features**:
  - Position tracking
  - Support for multiple assets
  - Flexible position sizing strategies
  - Stop loss and take profit mechanisms
  - Risk metrics calculation (drawdown, VaR, etc.)
  - Position correlation analysis

### 5. Performance Metrics Module
- **Purpose**: Calculate and analyze backtesting results
- **Features**:
  - Standard metrics (return, Sharpe ratio, drawdown)
  - Trading-specific metrics (win rate, profit factor)
  - Statistical analysis of returns
  - Results persistence and loading for comparison
  - Integration with performance tracker

### 6. Visualization Module
- **Purpose**: Visualize backtesting results and strategy behavior
- **Features**:
  - Equity curves
  - Drawdown charts
  - Trade entry/exit visualization
  - Performance metrics dashboard
  - SMC components visualization (Order Blocks, FVGs, Liquidity)

### 7. Integration Module
- **Purpose**: Connect with ML models and monitoring components
- **Features**:
  - Interface with model registry
  - Support for model-based strategies
  - Integration with performance tracking
  - Result storage in database

## Data Flow

1. Data is loaded from historical sources via the Data Ingestion Module
2. The data is processed and SMC indicators are calculated
3. Strategy Execution Module generates entry/exit signals based on the processed data
4. Order Execution Module simulates order placement and fills
5. Portfolio & Risk Management Module tracks positions and applies risk controls
6. Performance Metrics Module calculates and analyzes results
7. Results are visualized and stored for further analysis

## Key Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a well-defined responsibility and interface
2. **Extensibility**: New strategies, indicators, and order types can be easily added
3. **Configurability**: Parameters can be adjusted without code changes
4. **Performance**: Critical paths are optimized for fast simulation
5. **Reproducibility**: Results can be reliably reproduced with the same inputs
6. **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
