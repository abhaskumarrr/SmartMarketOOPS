# Performance Testing and Optimization Framework

## Overview

The Performance Testing and Optimization Framework is a comprehensive system for evaluating and optimizing the performance of the SmartMarketOOPS platform. It allows for systematic testing of various components including API endpoints, ML models, trading strategies, and end-to-end workflows.

## Features

1. **Diverse Test Types**
   - API Latency Testing
   - Load Testing
   - Stress Testing
   - ML Prediction Throughput Testing
   - Signal Generation Performance
   - Strategy Execution Benchmarking
   - End-to-End System Testing

2. **Automated Metrics Collection**
   - Throughput (requests/second)
   - Latency (min, avg, max, percentiles)
   - Error rates
   - CPU and memory utilization
   - ML-specific metrics (prediction time, model load time)
   - Trading-specific metrics (signal generation time, strategy execution time)

3. **Optimization Recommendations**
   - Automated analysis of performance bottlenecks
   - Categorized recommendations by impact and area
   - Implementation suggestions
   - Estimated performance improvements

4. **Historical Performance Tracking**
   - Store test results in database
   - Track performance over time
   - Compare results across system versions
   - Identify performance regressions

## Components

### 1. Performance Test Service (`perfTestService.ts`)

Core service that manages the creation, execution, and reporting of performance tests.

```typescript
// Create a performance test
const test = await perfTestService.createTest({
  name: "API Health Endpoint Test",
  testType: PerformanceTestType.API_LATENCY,
  duration: 60,
  concurrency: 50,
  targetEndpoint: "/api/health"
});

// Start a test
const result = await perfTestService.startTest(testId);

// Get test results
const results = await perfTestService.getTestResults(testId);
```

### 2. Load Test Service (`loadTestService.ts`)

Specialized service for running load tests using k6, a modern load testing tool.

```typescript
// Run a load test
const resultId = await loadTestService.runLoadTest({
  name: "Bridge API Load Test",
  stages: [
    { duration: 30, target: 10 },  // Ramp up to 10 users over 30 seconds
    { duration: 60, target: 50 },  // Ramp up to 50 users over 60 seconds
    { duration: 120, target: 50 }, // Stay at 50 users for 2 minutes
    { duration: 30, target: 0 }    // Ramp down to 0 users
  ],
  targetEndpoints: ["/api/bridge/predict", "/api/signals"]
}, saveResultCallback);
```

### 3. REST API Endpoints

The framework provides a full set of RESTful endpoints for managing performance tests:

- `POST /api/performance/tests` - Create a new performance test
- `GET /api/performance/tests` - List all performance tests
- `GET /api/performance/tests/:id` - Get a specific test
- `POST /api/performance/tests/:id/start` - Start a test
- `GET /api/performance/tests/:id/results` - Get results for a test
- `GET /api/performance/results/:id` - Get a specific test result
- `POST /api/performance/load-test` - Run a load test

### 4. CLI Tools

Command-line tools for running performance tests directly:

```bash
# Run an API latency test
npx ts-node scripts/run-performance-test.ts --type=API_LATENCY --endpoint=/api/health --duration=30 --concurrency=20

# Run a load test
npx ts-node scripts/run-performance-test.ts --type=LOAD_TEST --endpoint=/api/bridge/predict --duration=60 --concurrency=50

# Run an ML throughput test
npx ts-node scripts/run-performance-test.ts --type=ML_PREDICTION_THROUGHPUT --duration=60 --concurrency=10

# Save results to a file
npx ts-node scripts/run-performance-test.ts --type=API_LATENCY --endpoint=/api/health --outputFile=results.json
```

## Test Types

### API Latency Testing
Tests the response time of API endpoints under normal load conditions.

### Load Testing
Evaluates how the system performs under expected load conditions, usually with gradually increasing concurrent users.

### Stress Testing
Pushes the system beyond normal load to identify breaking points and failure modes.

### ML Prediction Throughput Testing
Measures how many ML predictions can be generated per second and the latency of predictions.

### Signal Generation Performance
Tests the throughput and latency of the signal generation service.

### Strategy Execution Benchmarking
Measures the performance of strategy execution, including rule evaluation and decision making.

### End-to-End System Testing
Tests the complete flow from ML prediction to signal generation to strategy execution.

## Database Models

The framework uses the following Prisma models:

1. **PerformanceTest**
   - Stores test configurations
   - Test type, duration, concurrency
   - Target endpoint, model, or strategy
   - Test options and parameters

2. **PerformanceTestResult**
   - Stores test execution results
   - Start and end times
   - Test status (running, completed, failed)
   - Performance metrics
   - Error details

3. **OptimizationRecommendation**
   - Generated improvement suggestions
   - Categorized by area (API, code, database, etc.)
   - Impact level (low, medium, high, critical)
   - Implementation details

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Testing**
   - Run performance tests after major feature additions
   - Schedule regular baseline tests (weekly/monthly)
   - Compare against previous baseline results

2. **Test in Production-Like Environment**
   - Use similar hardware specifications
   - Set up similar network conditions
   - Populate database with realistic data volumes

3. **Incremental Optimization**
   - Address critical impact recommendations first
   - Implement one optimization at a time
   - Re-test after each optimization to measure improvement

4. **Documentation**
   - Document performance requirements
   - Keep a log of optimization changes
   - Document known performance limitations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Integrate performance tests into CI/CD pipeline
   - Set performance budgets and thresholds
   - Fail builds that degrade performance beyond thresholds

2. **Real User Monitoring**
   - Collect performance data from real users
   - Compare synthetic tests with real-world performance
   - Identify performance issues affecting specific user segments

3. **Advanced Analysis**
   - Machine learning for anomaly detection
   - Predictive performance modeling
   - Automated capacity planning

4. **Distributed Load Testing**
   - Support for geographically distributed test agents
   - Simulate traffic from multiple regions
   - Test global performance characteristics
